🧠 Step 0: Understand OAuth 2.0 in Simple Words

Think of OAuth 2.0 like this:

"You want to access your GitHub profile using another app (like Postman) without giving your password. So GitHub gives Postman a temporary key (access token) after confirming it’s really you."

OAuth 2.0 Main Players
Role	Example
Client (App)	Postman (the tool requesting access)
Resource Owner	You (GitHub user)
Authorization Server	GitHub’s login system
Resource Server	GitHub’s API (stores user data)
🪜 Step 1: Register an OAuth App on GitHub

This step is like telling GitHub:

“Hey, I’m creating an app that wants to access users’ data safely using OAuth.”

How to Do It:

Go to 👉 https://github.com/settings/developers

Click "New OAuth App"

Fill in:

Application name: OAuth2 Test App

Homepage URL: https://example.com
(Just any dummy URL)

Authorization callback URL:
🔗 https://oauth.pstmn.io/v1/callback
(This is Postman’s special redirect URL where tokens will return)

Click Register application

You’ll get:

Client ID → like your App’s username

Client Secret → like your App’s password

Keep these safe — you’ll use them in Postman.

🧭 Step 2: Set Up OAuth 2.0 in Postman

Now let’s configure Postman to use that Client ID and Secret.

Steps:

Open Postman

Create a New Request → Name it “GitHub OAuth2 Test”

Go to the Authorization tab

In Type, select OAuth 2.0

Click Get New Access Token

⚙️ Step 3: Fill in OAuth Details in Postman
Field	What it means	Value
Token Name	Just a label for you	GitHub OAuth
Grant Type	Type of OAuth flow	Authorization Code
Callback URL	Where GitHub sends the token	https://oauth.pstmn.io/v1/callback
Auth URL	GitHub’s login page	https://github.com/login/oauth/authorize
Access Token URL	GitHub’s token generator	https://github.com/login/oauth/access_token
Client ID	Your App’s ID	(from GitHub app)
Client Secret	App’s password	(from GitHub app)
Scope	Permission level	read:user
Client Authentication	How Postman sends credentials	Send as Basic Auth Header

✅ Click Get New Access Token

🔑 Step 4: Authorize and Receive Token

Postman opens a new browser window

GitHub asks:

“Do you want to give access to OAuth2 Test App?”

Click Authorize

GitHub redirects back to Postman automatically

Postman shows a popup with your Access Token

Click Use Token ✅
Now Postman will use that token for API calls.

🔍 Step 5: Call the GitHub API (Using Token)

Now we’ll actually test it.

In Postman, choose:

Method: GET

URL: https://api.github.com/user

In Authorization tab, choose:

Type: Bearer Token

Token: (auto-filled from Step 4)

Click Send

✅ Result:
You’ll see a JSON response like:

{
  "login": "yourusername",
  "id": 123456,
  "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE2ODk4NTI=",
  "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/123456?v=4",
  "url": "https://api.github.com/users/yourusername"
}


🎉 That’s your GitHub profile data — fetched using OAuth 2.0 authorization!
